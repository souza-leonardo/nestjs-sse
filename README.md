# NESTJS SSE

This project aims to serve as a guide for those who want to implement Server-Sent Events (SSE) in their NestJS project.

Recently, I needed to implement SSE myself, but it was difficult to find resources that clearly addressed the specific details of this implementation. Due to this challenge, I created this repository with a simple yet complete example of SSE implementation in NestJS.

In the `chat-api.controller.ts` file, you can find the code for two SSE routes. In the comments above each route, I tried to describe the details involved in their implementation and the reasoning behind certain choices.

I hope this repository helps you if you came here looking to understand how to implement SSE using NestJS.
